## 🪐 Core Features

### 🧠 1. AI Design Recommendation Engine
- Generates smart design suggestions based on planetary data.  
- Considers factors like:
  - Atmospheric composition  
  - Gravity and pressure  
  - Temperature ranges  
  - Terrain and surface type  
- Recommends:
  - Structural materials  
  - Propulsion systems  
  - Communication and power modules  
  - Landing and heat management systems  

> Example:  
> _For Venus, use titanium alloy for structure and reinforced thermal shielding due to high surface temperature._
